# JavaScript-Projects
I'm currently taking a web programming course is college, consisting of CSS, HTML5, and JavaScript.

I've uploaded some of my Web Programming Projects that display my skills in HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.

To run this code, save all the files in a specific directory into the same folder, then open index.html in your preferred browser.

Thanks for giving this a look!
